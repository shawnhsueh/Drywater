# How to use LSTM model to predcit 50-days-trend of stock

pre-requisite: 
-standard anaconda modules
-tensorflow==1.6
-pandas==1.0.3
-sklearn==0.22.1
-numpy==1.18.1

1. update the historic stock price form
code\auto download update script
2. python LSTM_single.py


-issues:
1. Since the model in LSTM_single.py is trained on single stock historical price, the predictability is very limited.
